>
> Semantics:
> Semantics is the study of meaning.
>
> Meaning:
> Meaning, in semantics, is defined as being Extension: The thing in the world that the word/phrase refers to, plus Intention: The concepts/mental images that the word/phrase evokes.
>
> Syntax:
> Syntax is all about the structure of sentences, and what determines which words go where.
>
> Production:
> A production or production rule in computer science is a rewrite rule specifying a symbol substitution that can be recursively performed to generate new symbol sequences.
>
> Alphabet:
> A non-empty set is called alphabet when its intended use in string operations shall be indicated.
>
> Lexeme:
> A lexeme is a string of characters which forms a syntactic unit.
>
> Syntactic unit:
> Sentence is the "highest" (i.e., largest) syntactic unit,
> the lowest (i.e., smallest) syntactic units are words,
> the intermediate syntactic units are the phrases.
>
> Token:
> A token is a structure representing a lexeme that explicitly indicates its categorization for the purpose of parsing.
>
> Grammar:
> A grammar (when the context is not given, often called a formal grammar for clarity) is a set of production rules for strings in a formal language. The rules describe how to form strings from the language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A formal grammar is a set of rules for rewriting strings, along with a "start symbol" from which rewriting starts.

> Lexical grammar:
> A lexical grammar is a formal grammar defining the syntax of tokens.
